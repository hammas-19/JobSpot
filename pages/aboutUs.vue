                        My small business was using Email to keep up with support emails, and we were struggling. Email is
                        built for communication, not collaboration. With four employees trying to use the same support email
                        inbox, our team’s work was a huge burden to track. A ton of stuff was slipping through the cracks.
                        <br>Our customers weren’t happy, and neither were we. So I looked for a better solution.
                        Unfortunately, what I found was that the help desk software on the market was way more than our
                        small business needed. Packed with features that I’d never use, the help desks I tried were all
                        cluttered and overwhelming. <br>That’s why I started Groove. <br> Groove is the Shared Inbox for
                        <br> small businesses looking for an alternative to Email. Organize all your support emails in one
                        place, route them to the right people, and get more work done as a team. <br>No clutter. No
                    complexity. No extra features to confuse and overwhelm you. I’m proud to say that Groove is the
                    product that I wish existed back when I was looking for the perfect small business support software.
                    And I’m also proud that our 2,000+ customers agree. <br>Whether you’re ready to move on from email,
                    or you’re fed up with complicated help desk software, I hope you’ll give Groove a try. I’m confident
                    that you’ll love it. <br> And if, for any reason, you don’t think that Groove is the best way for
                    your small business to handle customer support — if it doesn’t make your team more productive and
                    your customers happier — then you won’t pay a penny. <br>Give it a shot, and email me at
                    alex@groovehq.com to let me know what you think. <br> CEO, Groove P.S. If you’d like to join
